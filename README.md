I love being creative and designing! I work as a Content Creation Expert for Person Centred Software in the UK. 

## About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an enthusiastic learner with a keen interest in graphic design and video editing, skills that I've honed through self-teaching. Currently delving into the world of Front End Web Development, I'm passionate about crafting digital experiences that are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly. My aspirations extend beyond the realm of code as I look forward to transitioning into UX/UI design and front end web development, a field where I see my future unfolding. Being a creative soul, I thrive on feedback and enjoy engaging in conversations that spark innovative ideas and perspectives.

Beyond the digital canvas, I express my creativity through music. A singer and guitarist, I find solace and joy in creating melodies and harmonies. When not immersed in the world of pixels and code, you'll likely find me playing my guitar or exploring the latest tunes. Football is another passion that adds excitement to my life, I follow the Premier League but support Portsmouth FC!

I firmly believe in the power of hard workâ€”a principle that has guided me through various pursuits. I'm excited about the journey ahead, embracing challenges and striving to make a positive impact through my work.

Let's connect, share ideas, and create something amazing together! ðŸš€

I am also a musician in a band called 'whitenoise' we play post hardcore and you can [check us out here!](https://linktr.ee/whitenoise_uk_)
